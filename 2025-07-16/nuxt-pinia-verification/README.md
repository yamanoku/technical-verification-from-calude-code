# Nuxt 4 + Latest Pinia Verification

This project verifies the compatibility of the latest versions of Pinia and @pinia/nuxt with Nuxt 4 for SSR applications.

## Package Versions

- **Pinia**: 2.3.0 (latest)
- **@pinia/nuxt**: 0.7.0 (latest)
- **@nuxt/ui**: 2.18.7 (for UI components)

## Features Implemented

### Authentication System
- TypeScript-powered Pinia store for user management
- Support for two user roles: `free` and `paid`
- SSR-safe state initialization and hydration
- LocalStorage persistence for client-side state

### Role-Based UI
- **Premium Banner**: Shown only to paid users with premium styling
- **Feature Access**: Different UI elements based on user role
- **Upgrade CTA**: Upgrade prompt for free users

### SSR Compatibility
- Proper hydration handling with `process.client` checks

## Demo Accounts

You can test with any username and choose:
- **Free User**: Basic features, upgrade prompts
- **Premium User**: Full feature access, premium banner

## Technical Architecture

### Store Structure (`stores/auth.ts`)
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  username: string
  email: string
  role: 'free' | 'paid'
}

interface AuthState {
  user: User | null
  isLoggedIn: boolean
}
```

### Key Features
